          <p class="lead">
            Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, formerly latinized as Algoritmi, was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer during the Abbasid Caliphate,
            a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. In the 12th century, Latin translations of his work on the Indian numerals introduced the decimal
            positional number system to the Western world. Al-Khwārizmī's The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing presented the
            first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations in Arabic. He is often considered one of the fathers of algebra.
            He revised Ptolemy's Geography and wrote on astronomy and astrology.
            Some words reflect the importance of al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics. "Algebra" is derived from al-jabr, one of the two operations he
            used to solve quadratic equations. Algorism and algorithm stem from Algoritmi, the Latin form of his name.
            His name is also the origin of (Spanish) guarismo and of (Portuguese) algarismo, both meaning digit.

      <h2 id="life">Life</h2>
      <p>
        Few details of al-Khwārizmī's life are known with certainty. He was born in a Persian family and Ibn al-Nadim gives his birthplace as Khwarezm in Greater Khorasan.<br>
        He was born in c. 780 and died in c. 850.
      </p>
      <h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        Al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy and cartography established the basis for innovation in algebra and trigonometry.
        His systematic approach to solving linear and quadratic equations led to algebra, a word derived from the title of his 830 book on the subject,
        "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing".
      </p>
      <h3>Algebra</h3>
      <p>
        The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing is a mathematical book written approximately 830 CE.
        The book was written with the encouragement of Caliph al-Ma'mun as a popular work on calculation and is replete with examples and applications
        to a wide range of problems in trade, surveying and legal inheritance. The term "algebra" is derived from the name of one of the basic operations
        with equations (al-jabr, meaning "restoration", referring to adding a number to both sides of the equation to consolidate or cancel terms) described in this book.
        The book was translated in Latin as Liber algebrae et almucabala by Robert of Chester (Segovia, 1145) hence "algebra", and also by Gerard of Cremona.
        A unique Arabic copy is kept at Oxford and was translated in 1831 by F. Rosen. A Latin translation is kept in Cambridge.
        It provided an exhaustive account of solving polynomial equations up to the second degree and discussed the fundamental methods of "reduction" and "balancing",
        referring to the transposition of terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.
      </p>
      <h3>Arithmetic</h3>
      <p>
        Al-Khwārizmī's second major work was on the subject of arithmetic, which survived in a Latin translation but was lost in the original Arabic.
        The translation was most likely done in the 12th century by Adelard of Bath, who had also translated the astronomical tables in 1126.
        The Latin manuscripts are untitled, but are commonly referred to by the first two words with which they start: Dixit algorizmi ("So said al-Khwārizmī"),
        or Algoritmi de numero Indorum ("al-Khwārizmī on the Hindu Art of Reckoning"), a name given to the work by Baldassarre Boncompagni in 1857.
        The original Arabic title was possibly Kitāb al-Jam‘ wat-Tafrīq bi-Ḥisāb al-Hind ("The Book of Addition and Subtraction According to the Hindu Calculation").
      </p>
      <h3>Astronomy</h3>
      <p>
        Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical,
        astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. This is the first of many Arabic Zijes based on the Indian astronomical methods known
        as the sindhind. The work contains tables for the movements of the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. This work marked the turning point in
        Islamic astronomy. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3>Trigonometry</h3>
      <p>
        Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind also contained tables for the trigonometric functions of sines and cosine. A related treatise on spherical trigonometry is also attributed to him
      </p>
      <h3>Geography</h3>
      <p>
        Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ also known as his Geography, which was finished in 833. It is a major reworking of Ptolemy's 2nd-century Geography,
        consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction.
      </p>
      <h3>Jewish calendar</h3>
      <p>
        Al-Khwārizmī wrote several other works including a treatise on the Hebrew calendar, titled Risāla fi istikhrāj ta’rīkh al-yahūd. It describes the Metonic cycle,
        a 19-year intercalation cycle; the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month Tishrei shall fall;
        calculates the interval between the Anno Mundi or Jewish year and the Seleucid era; and gives rules for determining the mean longitude of the sun and the moon
        using the Hebrew calendar. Similar material is found in the works of Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī and Maimonides.
      </p>
      <h3>Other works</h3>
      <p>
        Ibn al-Nadim's Kitāb al-Fihrist, an index of Arabic books, mentions al-Khwārizmī's Kitāb al-Taʾrīkh, a book of annals. No direct manuscript survives;
        however, a copy had reached Nusaybin by the 11th century, where its metropolitan bishop, Mar Elyas bar Shinaya, found it.
        Elias's chronicle quotes it from "the death of the Prophet" through to 169 AH, at which point Elias's text itself hits a lacuna.
        Several Arabic manuscripts in Berlin, Istanbul, Tashkent, Cairo and Paris contain further material that surely or with some probability comes
        from al-Khwārizmī. The Istanbul manuscript contains a paper on sundials; the Fihrist credits al-Khwārizmī with Kitāb ar-Rukhāma(t).
        Other papers, such as one on the determination of the direction of Mecca, are on the spherical astronomy.
        Two texts deserve special interest on the morning width (Ma‘rifat sa‘at al-mashriq fī kull balad) and the determination of
        the azimuth from a height (Ma‘rifat al-samt min qibal al-irtifā‘).
        He also wrote two books on using and constructing astrolabes.
